# This script assumes that you are using Django with Celery,
# and that you have the necessary configurations in place.
# The 'your_project.settings' should be replaced with the actual Django project's settings module.

# To run this script, you would typically use the Celery command line tool,
# such as 'celery -A integration_test_with_celery.py test_task',
# which will execute the 'test_task' function as a Celery task.
